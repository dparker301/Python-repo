## (Indexing) Will print all the elements starting with element zero 
#top_cities = ['New York City', 'Los Angeles', 'Chicago', 'Houston', 'Phoenix']
#print(top_cities)



## Will print the first elements starting with element zero 
#top_cities = ['New York City', 'Los Angeles', 'Chicago', 'Houston', 'Phoenix']
#print (top_cities[0])


## Will print the -5 but not the -6 because six 
#top_cities = ['New York City', 'Los Angeles', 'Chicago', 'Houston', 'Phoenix']
#print (top_cities[-5])

##Slicing

# Define the list of top cities
#top_cities = ["New York", "Los Angeles", "Chicago", "Houston", "Phoenix"]

# Use slicing to get the first two items
#first_two_cities = top_cities[0:2]

# Print the result
#print("The first two top cities are:", first_two_cities)
